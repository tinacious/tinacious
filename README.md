### Hi, my name is Tina 🙋🏻‍♀️

📍 **Current location**: _Vancouver, BC_ 🏞   **Previous location**: _Toronto, ON_ 🏙   **Next location**: _?¿_ 🌍

I'm a Full Stack Software Developer from Canada working primarily in JavaScript and Ruby. I am passionate about building awesome, maintainable software that's in it for the long haul. 🚚

My favourite technologies include JavaScript, React, Node.js, Vue, Ruby on Rails, PostGres, MySQL, and CSS (SCSS, Stylus, etc.). In a past life I used PHP and did development using WordPress, Drupal, and ProcessWire.
